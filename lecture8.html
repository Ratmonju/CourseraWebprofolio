            It is not the critic who counts; not man who point how
            the strong man stamples, or where the door of deeds could have
            done them better. the credit belongd to the man who is actually 
            in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
            who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again 
            becuase there is no efferot without error and shortcomming; but who
            does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great  
            enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy
            cause; who at the best know in the end the triumph of high
            achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, AT least fails
            while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those 
            cold and timid souls who neither know neither know victory nor defeat.
